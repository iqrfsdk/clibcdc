/**
 * Implements public interface of CDCInterface abstract class for communication
 * support between PC and GW-USB-04 device.
 *
 * Properties:
 * - Dedicated thread for reading from COM-port( COM1 is default ).
 * - Exception mechanism for dealing with some type of errors.
 * - Simple validation mechanism for incoming message data.
 * - Inner timeout settings(usually 5000 ms) for waiting for operations,
 *     user-defined timeout settings are not currently supported.
 * - If some serious error occurs during reading from COM-port, the reading thread is
 *   automatically stopped. Stopped thread is currently not possible to start
 *   again - for continuous working you must destruct the object and
 *   construct the another one. Activity of reading thread can be tested via
 *   @c isReceptionStopped function. If some method from public interface is
 *   called after the reading thread was stopped, exception will be thrown.
 * - Information about reading errors can be received via @c getLastReceptionError
 	 function.
 * - If any error in input asynchronous message is discovered, @c NULL will be
 *   returned as a first parameter to asynchronous listener, and @c 0 as the
 *   second one.
